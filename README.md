•	Employee Management: Once authenticated, administrators have access to add, update, delete, and view user information.
•	Server-Side Validation: All input data undergoes server-side validation to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.
•	Responsive Design: The application interface is designed using Bootstrap, ensuring responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.
•	Secure Authentication: Passwords are securely stored using encryption techniques to enhance data security.
•	Search Bar: Search for employees based on various criteria such as name, job title, department, or any other relevant attribute. Search results are displayed dynamically, enabling administrators to quickly locate specific employees.
